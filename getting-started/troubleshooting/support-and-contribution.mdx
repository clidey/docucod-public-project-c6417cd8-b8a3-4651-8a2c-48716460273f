# Where to Get Help & Contribute

This page guides you through the official channels for community support, how to responsibly report issues, and ways you can contribute back to the **node-addon-api** project. Whether you are seeking help with your native addon development, want to engage with other developers, or wish to become an active contributor, this guide points you to the essential next steps.

## 1. Community and Support Channels

Connecting with the community is vital for timely help and sharing knowledge. The **node-addon-api** project maintains several active venues where users and contributors interact:

- **GitHub Issues**: The primary place to report bugs, suggest features, or ask development-related questions.
  - Link: [node-addon-api Issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api/issues)
  
- **GitHub Discussions**: For general questions, ideas, or community discussion not related to bugs.
  - Link: [node-addon-api Discussions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api/discussions)

- **Node.js GitHub Repository**: Since node-addon-api relates to Node.js internals, you may find cross-project discussion helpful.
  - Link: [Node.js GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node)

- **Stack Overflow**: Use the `node-addon-api` tag to ask usage questions.
  - Link: [Stack Overflow - node-addon-api](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node-addon-api)

- **Node.js Community Slack & Forums**: Interact with Node.js core developers and addon maintainers.
  - Link: [Node.js Slack Invite](https://nodejs.slack.com/)


<Tip>
When posting questions or issues, provide detailed information such as your operating system, Node.js version, `node-addon-api` version, relevant code snippets (e.g., your `binding.gyp`), and error messages. This will enable others to help you effectively.
</Tip>


## 2. Responsible Issue Reporting

Clear, precise issue reports help maintainers triage and fix problems efficiently. Follow these best practices when opening issues:

- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Use descriptive titles summarizing the problem.
- Provide a minimal reproducible example, ideally a small code snippet or repository link.
- Include your environment details:
  - Node.js version
  - Operating system and version
  - `node-addon-api` version
  - Build tools and configurations (e.g., `binding.gyp`, use of `node-gyp`)
- Mention any error messages or logs encountered.

<Tip>
If your issue relates to build problems, review the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/addons.html#getting-started-troubleshooting) guide first to check common pitfalls.
</Tip>

## 3. Contribution Opportunities
