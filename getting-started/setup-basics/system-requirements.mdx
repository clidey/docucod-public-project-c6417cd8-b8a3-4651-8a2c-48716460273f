# Prerequisites and System Requirements

This page provides a clear overview of the essential prerequisites and system requirements to successfully build and use **node-addon-api**. Understanding these requirements ensures a smooth setup and integration experience before starting development.

---

## 1. Supported Node.js Versions

- **Minimum Node.js Version:** Node.js v10 or later is required to support the Node-API and node-addon-api.
- The **Node-API version** corresponds to your Node.js runtime. You can verify your Node.js version and the Node-API version by running:

```bash
node -p "process.versions.node"
node -p "process.versions.napi"
```

- The node-addon-api package supports all actively maintained Node.js versions that include ABI stable Node-API support.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

node-addon-api works on the three major platforms supported by Node.js:

- **Linux**
- **macOS**
- **Windows**

There are platform-specific compiler and build considerations, especially regarding macOS, which requires additional build flag settings to manage symbol visibility.


## 3. Compiler and Build Tool Requirements

### Key Build Tools

- **node-gyp**: The primary native build system for compiling Node.js addons written in C++.
  - node-gyp manages configurations through the `binding.gyp` file.
  - Installation and usage details are available in the [node-gyp documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp).

### Compiler Support

- A C++11 compatible compiler is required:
  - **Windows:** Visual Studio 2017 or later with Desktop development workload
  - **macOS:** Xcode 9 or later
  - **Linux:** GCC 5 or later or Clang

### Build Flags and Configurations

- The project enforces strict compiler warnings and errors such as `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-Werror`, and `-Wunused-parameter`.
- For macOS, these additional `cflags` are necessary to prevent symbol export issues:

```gyp
'conditions': [
  ['OS=="mac"', {
    'cflags+': ['-fvisibility=hidden'],
    'xcode_settings': {
      'OTHER_CFLAGS': ['-fvisibility=hidden']
    }
  }]
]
```

- This configuration ensures proper symbol visibility and compatibility with OS X loaders.


## 4. Dependency and Environment Requirements

- **Node.js Native Addon Build Tools:** You must have [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp), Python 2.7 or Python 3.x, and relevant build tools installed (e.g., make, MSBuild).
- **Python:** Required for node-gyp to run.
- **C++ Standard Library:** The C++ ABI and standard libraries on your platform must support C++11 features.
- **Environment Variables:** Occasionally, environment variables such as `NAPI_VERSION` and `npm_config_disable_deprecated` can override defaults; these must be set with care.


## 5. Practical Verification

Before starting your project, verify your system meets the following:

- **Node.js version check:** 

```bash
node -v
```

- **Node-API version check:** 

```bash
node -p "process.versions.napi"
```

- **node-gyp version:** 

```bash
node-gyp -v
```

- **Compiler availability:** 

```bash
# example on Linux/macOS
g++ --version

# example on Windows (using Developer Command Prompt)
cl
```


## 6. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- Using outdated compilers not compatible with C++11 can result in build failures.
- Ensure `node-gyp` is installed globally or locally and correctly configured with Python and your compiler toolchain.
- On macOS, do not skip the visibility flags; omission will cause build/link errors.
- Keep your Node.js version current to leverage the latest stable Node-API features.


## 7. Summary

By meeting these prerequisites and system requirements, you establish a solid foundation for building native addons using node-addon-api. This preparation avoids common build blockers and compatibility issues.

For detailed installation instructions and build environment configuration, proceed to the [Installation Instructions](../install-instructions) and [Configuring Your Build Environment](../configuring-build) pages.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues">
<Accordion title="Node.js Version Is Too Low">
Ensure you are running Node.js version 10 or higher. Use `node -v` to check your version. Upgrade Node.js if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler Missing or Unsupported">
Verify that your systemâ€™s compiler supports C++11:

- On macOS/Linux, running `g++ --version` or `clang++ --version` should return version details.
- On Windows, open the Developer Command Prompt and run `cl` to confirm Visual Studio compiler access.

If missing, install the appropriate tools:
- Windows: Visual Studio with C++ workload
- macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- Linux: Install GCC or Clang packages
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="node-gyp Setup Failures">
- Confirm Python is installed and accessible (version 2.7 or 3.x).
- Configure node-gyp using this command if necessary:

  ```bash
  npm install -g node-gyp
  ```

- On some systems, environment variables like `PYTHON` must point to python executable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Failures on macOS Related to Symbol Visibility">
Ensure your `binding.gyp` contains the macOS-specific visibility flags:

```gyp
'conditions': [
  ['OS=="mac"', {
    'cflags+': ['-fvisibility=hidden'],
    'xcode_settings': {
      'GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN': 'YES',
      'OTHER_CFLAGS': ['-fvisibility=hidden']
    }
  }]
]
```

Omitting these will cause hard-to-diagnose build or runtime errors.
