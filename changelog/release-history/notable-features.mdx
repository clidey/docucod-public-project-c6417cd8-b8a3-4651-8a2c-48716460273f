# Notable Features & Enhancements

Explore a curated summary of the most impactful features, optimizations, and improvements introduced in recent node-addon-api releases. These highlights focus on user-facing benefits such as improved build integration, enhanced exception support, and refined performance, enabling you to quickly grasp the upgrade value and leverage new capabilities effectively.

---

## 1. Enhanced Build System Integration

### Flexible Exception Handling Options
Users can now select from multiple Node-API wrapper variants via `binding.gyp` configuration to better match their native addon's exception handling needs:
- **No exceptions (`node_addon_api`)**: Suitable for environments that disable C++ exceptions for stricter error control and smaller binaries.
- **Exceptions for `Napi::Error` only (`node_addon_api_except`)**: Enables fine-grained exception handling restricted to Node-API errors.
- **Catch all native C++ exceptions (`node_addon_api_except_all`)**: Provides comprehensive integration with legacy or third-party C++ code that throws diverse exceptions.

This flexibility empowers developers to tailor the reliability and error management of their addons to their project requirements.

### Variant Targets and Customization
Variant targets such as `binding_noexcept`, `binding_swallowexcept`, and `binding_custom_namespace` have been introduced and refined:
- **`binding_noexcept`** disables C++ exceptions, ensuring builds are compatible on exception-disabled platforms.
- **`binding_swallowexcept`** allows controlling uncaught exceptions' behavior to avoid fatal process termination in terminating environments.
- **`binding_custom_namespace`** enables defining custom C++ namespaces for the Node-API wrapper classes to prevent symbol collisions.

Practical usage involves configuring these variants in your `binding.gyp` to match your project's build policies and namespace conventions.

<Tip>
Define the appropriate `dependencies` and preprocessor `defines` in your `binding.gyp` to activate the desired variant. This modular approach simplifies managing multiple build flavors simultaneously.
</Tip>

### Platform-Specific Build Flags
Support for macOS-specific compiler flags (`-fvisibility=hidden`) and Xcode settings has been added to optimize symbol visibility and binary size. Windows and Linux platform considerations are actively maintained to ensure seamless cross-platform compatibility.

## 2. Improved Source Organization and Build Automation

### Dynamic Source Compilation
The test suite and sample bindings utilize dynamic source file lists generated via Node.js scripts (e.g., `injectTestParams` and `generate-binding-cc.js`), allowing maintainers to:
- Automatically include relevant test source files.
- Generate binding source files (`generated/binding.cc`) during build time, ensuring up-to-date compilation without manual file management.

This automation streamlines development workflows and reduces build maintenance overhead.

### Clear Dependency Management
Targets explicitly declare dependencies on generated sources and Node-API headers to guarantee correct build order and inclusion. This reduces build errors and ensures consistent environment setups across developer machines and CI/CD pipelines.

## 3. Expanded Support for Exception Handling and Safety

### Comprehensive Exception Model
The introduction and refinement of the `except.gypi`, `except_all` targets, and corresponding definitions enable better blending of C++ exception semantics with Node.js error management:
- Users can seamlessly throw and catch exceptions derived from `Napi::Error` or all native exceptions.
- Preprocessor flags like `NODE_ADDON_API_CPP_EXCEPTIONS_ALL` offer backward-compatible options for legacy exception flows.

### Safe Exception Swallowing
The `NODE_API_SWALLOW_UNTHROWABLE_EXCEPTIONS` define prevents fatal crashes on uncatchable exceptions during the addon lifecycle, catering to scenarios where addon stability is critical over strict error halting.

<Tip>
Enable `NODE_API_SWALLOW_UNTHROWABLE_EXCEPTIONS` carefully, understanding that it bypasses fatal error termination and may mask certain runtime issues.
</Tip>

## 4. Better Finalizer and Resource Management

A key enhancement involves more configurable finalizer behavior, allowing users to:
- Opt into basic finalizers for tighter control using `NODE_ADDON_API_REQUIRE_BASIC_FINALIZERS`.
- Balance addon performance versus finalizer API restrictions.

This empowers addon authors to refine native resource lifecycle management in harmony with their performance and safety goals.

---

## 5. Versioning and Compatibility

The package continues to support LTS Node.js versions starting with Node.js 18.x, with clear versioning and deprecation policies maintained in the changelog. Badge-based version indicators help users to identify the minimum supported Node-API version and adjust their addon compatibility matrix accordingly.

---

## Practical Upgrade Tips

- Review your `binding.gyp` to utilize the improved variant targets and defines that best fit your exception and build policy.
- Leverage the dynamic source generation features in test and sample projects to simplify maintenance.
- Test with both exception-enabled and noexcept variants to confirm robustness across environments.
- Consult the related [Setup and Build System Integration guide](/api-reference/integration-build/setup-build) for detailed examples on adopting these enhancements.
