# Fixed Issues & Bug Patches

This page presents a detailed overview of major bugs, regressions, and stability issues that have been fixed in recent updates to **node-addon-api**. It is designed to help maintainers and end users quickly verify whether their specific problems have been addressed, promoting confidence in upgrading and ensuring smoother native addon development.

---

## Understanding the Importance of Fixes

Maintaining stability in native addons is critical due to the complex interaction between C++ code and JavaScript runtimes. This page focuses solely on bug fixes and regressions resolved in the **node-addon-api** project, rather than on feature additions or breaking changes. It serves as a trustworthy record of improvements that directly impact reliability and developer productivity.


---

## How to Use This Page

- **Navigating by Version:** The fixes are organized in reverse chronological order by version to help you identify recent stability improvements.
- **Issue Verification:** If you encountered a bug or regression, locate your version or later to check if it was resolved.
- **Upgrade Guidance:** Knowing which bugs have been fixed can help decide on the best upgrade timing for your projects.

## Recent Fixes and Resolutions

### Version 8.5.0 (Latest Release)
- Fixed a critical regression in `Napi::ObjectWrap` where wrapped instances could cause unexpected memory leakage under certain reference counting scenarios.
- Resolved a corner case where exception forwarding from JavaScript callbacks to C++ was blocked when using the `node_addon_api_except_all` target.
- Patched issues with `ThreadSafeFunction` lifetime management, preventing premature cleanup that could cause crashes during concurrent calls.


### Version 8.4.0
- Fixed incorrect behavior in `Napi::Maybe` conversions that caused silent failures when C++ exceptions were disabled.
- Addressed a bug where setting properties with `Napi::Object::Set` did not correctly handle certain edge cases involving property descriptors.
- Fixed build errors on macOS related to visibility flags when using the latest Xcode toolchains.


### Version 8.3.1
- Patched a regression affecting async worker cancellation where callback threads were not properly joined, sometimes hanging the event loop.
- Corrected lifetime management for `Napi::FunctionReference` instances to avoid dangling references on addon teardown.


### Version 8.3.0
- Fixed multiple minor leaks in internal handles during calling of wrapped JavaScript functions from native C++ code.
- Corrected error propagation paths when exceptions occur during resource finalization.
- Ensured compatibility fixes for Node.js 20 and the latest Node-API 11 support.

## Common Bug Categories Addressed

### Memory and Resource Management
Many bugs fixed involved improper reference counting, finalizer invocation order, or premature releasing of native objects, which could lead to memory leaks or crashes.

### Exception Handling
Issues related to how JavaScript exceptions are thrown, caught, and propagated into C++ code, especially when mixing C++ exceptions with Node-API error handling, have been refined.

### Async and Thread-Safety
Fixes focused on the stability of asynchronous helpers such as `AsyncWorker` and `ThreadSafeFunction` to prevent race conditions, crashes, and unexpected behavior.

### Build and Platform Stability
Build configuration fixes ensure that the module builds cleanly across platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and compiler toolchains, avoiding incompatibilities and warnings.

## Best Practices After Upgrading

- **Test Native Addon Workflows:** After upgrading, run your complete suite of native addon tests, paying special attention to asynchronous code and exception scenarios.
- **Review Exception Handling:** Ensure your addonâ€™s error handling logic aligns with changes in exception propagation behavior as fixed bugs might affect subtle flows.
- **Update Build Configurations:** Check your `binding.gyp` or `CMakeLists.txt` files for any updated flags or deprecations relevant to your development platform.
