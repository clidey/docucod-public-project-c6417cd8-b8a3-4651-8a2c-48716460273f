# Version Timeline

Explore each release of the `node-addon-api` project at a glance through this comprehensive version timeline. This page offers a clear survey of all published versions, their release dates, and the support duration associated with each. Understanding this timeline is essential to grasp the evolution of `node-addon-api` and to plan your adoption strategy based on long-term support commitments.

## Understanding the Version Timeline

The Version Timeline acts as your navigational tool to review every `node-addon-api` release, helping you quickly assess which versions align best with your project's needs.

Key information provided includes:

- **Version Numbers:** Semantic versioning used to clearly communicate the scale of changes—major, minor, or patches.
- **Release Dates:** Precise dates marking when each version was published, essential for tracking new features or fixes over time.
- **Support Window:** Highlights how long each version will be officially supported, enabling planning for upgrades and maintenance.

This timeline empowers you to:

- Pinpoint the latest stable releases.
- Identify which versions are actively supported or nearing end-of-life.
- Strategize version compatibility with your Node.js runtime environment based on support policies.

## Version Numbering and Support Policy

- **Semantic Versioning:** The versioning follows the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.
  - **Major releases** introduce breaking changes or drop support for older Node.js versions.
  - **Minor releases** add backward-compatible features.
  - **Patch releases** address bug fixes and minor improvements.

- **Support Commitment:**
  - Releases generally align with the [current Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.dev/en/about/releases/).
  - Older Node.js versions dropped from maintenance will no longer be supported by new major `node-addon-api` releases.
  - Major releases that drop support will update the minimum required Node.js version accordingly.

## Practical Use of the Timeline

When choosing a version of `node-addon-api`, consider the following typical scenarios:

- **Starting a New Project:**
  - Prefer the latest major release to leverage new features and full support.

- **Maintaining Legacy Code:**
  - Select a version that matches your current Node.js environment's lifecycle to avoid compatibility issues.

- **Preparing for Upgrades:**
  - Use the timeline to identify upcoming deprecations and plan migration paths proactively.

## Release Insights and Process

- Releases are typically triggered via GitHub workflows such as the `release-please` action.
- Version bumps occur automatically after thorough testing and validation.
- Detailed changelogs accompany each release to clarify new features, fixes, and breaking changes.
- In rare cases, manual release steps may be performed, adhering to strict contribution and release policies.

## Troubleshooting Version Compatibility

Version compatibility is crucial to avoid unexpected API mismatches or runtime errors.

- Use the `VersionManagement` API at runtime to query the Node-API version and Node.js version:

```cpp
uint32_t napiVersion = Napi::VersionManagement::GetNapiVersion(env);
const napi_node_version* nodeVersion = Napi::VersionManagement::GetNodeVersion(env);
```

- Combine this with your chosen `node-addon-api` version to ensure supported bindings.

- Consult the [Versioning and Compatibility guide](/concepts/integration-and-workflows/versioning-compatibility) for detailed strategies.
