# Key Features at a Glance

**Unlock the power of native Node.js addons with node-addon-api's robust and intuitive C++ wrappers.** This page highlights the primary features that make node-addon-api the preferred choice for creating efficient, maintainable, and ABI-stable native modules.

---

## Overview

node-addon-api provides a header-only C++ abstraction over Node-API, enabling native addon developers to interact with JavaScript values and runtime environments seamlessly. Its core features simplify the complex task of building addons by enhancing type safety, error handling, asynchronous operations, and compatibility management.

This summary introduces the essential capabilities of node-addon-api to help you quickly grasp its value and guide you toward deeper explorations of each aspect.

---

## Primary Features

### 1. Native Object and Value Wrappers

node-addon-api offers C++ classes that wrap JavaScript core types such as:

- **Primitive values:** `Number`, `Boolean`, `String`, `Symbol`, `BigInt`, etc.
- **Object types:** `Object`, `Array`, `Function`
- **Buffer management:** `Buffer`, `ArrayBuffer`, and various `TypedArray` implementations

By using these wrappers, you get type safety, intuitive interfaces, and integrated lifetime management, making interactions with the JavaScript environment predictable and straightforward.

_Example: Creating a JavaScript string from C++_

```cpp
Napi::String greeting = Napi::String::New(env, "Hello from node-addon-api!");
```

---

### 2. Exception Handling and Error Management

The library seamlessly integrates C++ exceptions with JavaScript exceptions. This allows you to throw and catch errors naturally in C++, while ensuring they propagate correctly to JavaScript.

- Support for different exception handling modes (_no exceptions_, _Napi::Error only_, _all exceptions_)
- Custom error types derived from `Napi::Error`
- Explicit mechanisms to handle terminating environments

_Practical benefit:_ Prevents native module crashes due to unhandled errors and improves developer debugging experience.

---

### 3. Asynchronous Worker & Execution Support

node-addon-api includes classes designed to simplify asynchronous execution patterns, enabling smooth integration of time-consuming native operations without blocking the JavaScript event loop.

- `AsyncWorker`: A base class to run tasks in background threads
- Variants supporting progress reporting and context passing
- Integration with promises and thread-safe callbacks

_Use case example:_ Running a CPU-intensive computation in a background thread while providing progress updates to JavaScript.

---

### 4. Memory Management and Object Lifetime

Automatic management of JavaScript object lifetimes is critical to native addon stability. node-addon-api offers:

- `ObjectWrap`: Base class to wrap native C++ classes with JS objects
- Handle scope management to control garbage collection boundaries
- Finalizer callbacks for executing clean-up logic when objects are collected

_Outcome:_ Safe, leak-free addons with well-defined resource lifetimes.

---

### 5. Type Safety Enhancements

The wrappers enforce strict type checks and conversions, reducing runtime errors caused by unexpected JavaScript types.

- Explicit conversions between C++ native types and JavaScript counterparts
- Support for [`Maybe`](maybe/check.md) types to avoid unchecked exceptions

This helps developers write robust, predictable code that validates inputs and handles type mismatches gracefully.

---

### 6. ABI Stability and Compatibility Badges

node-addon-api maintains binary compatibility (ABI stability) across Node.js versions supporting Node-API, allowing compiled addons to work seamlessly on different Node.js LTS versions without recompilation.

The project provides badges (shields) indicating the minimum Node-API version support, enabling you to:

- Quickly identify Node.js compatibility
- Communicate addon requirements clearly to users

_Benefit:_ Simplifies maintenance and deployment of native addons in diverse production environments.

## Real-World Context

Imagine you are building a high-performance image processing addon. Using node-addon-api lets you:

- Safely map raw pixel data buffers to JS
- Expose asynchronous processing without blocking the event loop
- Catch exceptions during native computations and relay them as JS errors
- Ensure your compiled module runs across Node.js 18 and newer versions

This concise feature set enables you to focus on algorithm development rather than infrastructure.
